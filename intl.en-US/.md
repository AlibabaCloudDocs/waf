# View security reports

Web Application Firewall \(WAF\) provides security reports to display the protection records of each protection module. You can view the web security, bot management, and access control and throttling records on domains that are added to WAF. This allows you to analyze business security.

**Note:** This topic describes security reports in the WAF console released in January 2020. If your WAF instance was created before this date, see [WAF security reports](/intl.en-US/User Guide (Unavailable Soon)/WAF security reports.md).

## Prerequisites

-   A WAF instance is purchased. For more information, see [Purchase a WAF instance](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Subscription/Purchase a WAF instance.md).
-   Your website is added to the WAF console. For more information, see [Add domain names](/intl.en-US/Website Access/Website access with CNAME/Add domain names.md).

## Access the security report page

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=waf).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the resource group to which the instance belongs and the region, **Mainland China** or **International**, in which the instance is deployed.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **SecurityÂ report**.

4.  On the Security report page that appears, click any of the following tabs to view the reports of required types: **Web Security**, **Bot Management**, and **Access Control/Throttling**.


## Web Security tab

The **Web Security** tab displays protection records of the following modules: **Web Intrusion Prevention**, **Data Leakage Prevention**, **Account Security**, and **Positive Security Model**.

-   **Web Intrusion Prevention**: displays all web application attacks blocked by WAF. This tab consists of two areas: attack statistics \(area 1 in the figure\) and attack details \(area 2 in the figure\). You can specify a domain and query time period to search for corresponding data.
