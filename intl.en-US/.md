# View security reports

Web Application Firewall \(WAF\) provides security reports that display the protection records of each protection module. The protection records cover the web security, bot management, and access control and throttling on domain names that WAF protects. These records allow you to analyze business security.

## Prerequisites

-   Your website is added to the WAF console. For more information, see [Add websites](/intl.en-US/Website Access/Website access with CNAME/Add websites.md).
-   Your websites are protected by WAF.

    After you add a domain name to WAF, the **RegEx Protection Engine** and **HTTP Flood Protection** features are enabled by default. You need to manually enable other features. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Website Protection Settings/Overview.md).


## Access the security report page

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=waf).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the resource group to which the instance belongs and the region, **Mainland China** or **International**, in which the instance is deployed.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **SecurityÂ report**.

4.  On the Security report page, click one of the following tabs to view the required reports: **Web Security**, **Bot Management**, and **Access Control/Throttling**.


## Web Security tab

The **Web Security** tab displays protection records about features, such as **Web Intrusion Prevention**, **Data Leakage Prevention**, **Account Security**, **Positive Security Model**, and **API Request Security**. You can click a tab to view the protection records about a specific feature.

**Note:**

-   Subscription WAF instances of the Pro edition deployed in mainland China do not support **API Request Security**.
-   Subscription WAF instances of the Pro edition deployed outside mainland China do not support **API Request Security** and **Positive Security Model**.

-   **Web Intrusion Prevention**: displays all web application attacks blocked by WAF. This tab consists of two parts: attack statistics \(part 1 in the following figure\) and attack details \(part 2 in the following figure\). You can specify a domain name and time period to search for corresponding data.
