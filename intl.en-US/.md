# View overall information

This topic describes the Overview page of the Web Application Firewall \(WAF\) console. The Overview page displays the protection information of websites that you add to WAF, including attack events, urgent vulnerabilities, protection statistics, and request analysis charts. You can check the security status of your websites and perform security analysis based on the information displayed on this page.

## Prerequisite

-   Your website is added to the WAF console. For more information, see [Add websites](/intl.en-US/Website Access/Website access with CNAME/Add websites.md).
-   Your websites are protected by WAF.

    After you add a domain name to WAF, the **RegEx Protection Engine** and **HTTP Flood Protection** features are enabled by default. You need to manually enable other features. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Website Protection Settings/Overview.md).


## Access the Overview page

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://yundun.console.aliyun.com/?p=waf).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select the resource group to which the instance belongs and the region, **Mainland China** or **International**, in which the instance is deployed.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Overview**.

4.  In the upper-left corner of the **Overview** page, select a specific domain name or All. Then, select a time period from **Real-time**, **Today**, **7 Days**, **30 Days**, or **Customize** to view the overall information.

    **Note:** The overall information for the last 30 days is available. You can customize a time period within the last 30 days.


## Overview page

The Overview page includes the following three parts:

-   [Attack events and urgent vulnerabilities](#section_amz_tkc_a42) \(part 1 in the following figure\)
-   [Protection statistics](#section_j0m_0ap_xlu) \(part 2 in the following figure\)
-   [Request analysis charts](#section_999_cq4_a0g) \(part 3 in the following figure\)

![Overview page](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5633219951/p96669.png)

## Attack events and urgent vulnerabilities

The **Vulnerabilities** tab is displayed by default. You can view the updates to protection rules for the newly disclosed security vulnerabilities.

On the **Vulnerabilities** tab, click a vulnerability name to go to the **Details of Emergency Vulnerability** panel. In the panel, you can view protection details, including information about protection rules and affected assets. In the **Details of Emergency Vulnerability** panel, click the number below **Protected Assets** to go to the Website Access page.

The **Events** tab displays historical attack events. WAF aggregates blocked attacks into events so that you can quickly know attacks and threats to your website.

**Note:** If you select All, the total numbers of attacks and events on all domain names are displayed. You can also select a specific domain name to view the relevant events.

You can click an event to view its details and information about the type of this event. For example, in the HTTP Flood Protection section, you can view the top 5 User-Agents, Referrers, requested URLs of attacks and source IP addresses that initiate the most attacks. You can also view the number of attacks that are blocked for each of these items. The system provides protection suggestions below the data.

## Protection statistics

This part displays the number of **all** received requests and the numbers of requests that trigger the checks of the following modules: **Web Intrusion Prevention**, **HTTP Flood Protection**, **Scan Protection**, **Access Control**, and **Blocked Bot Attacks**.

**Note:** The Blocked Bot Attacks module is available only in the new protection engine. For more information, see [Protection engine upgrade](/intl.en-US/Announcements & Updates/Protection engine upgrade.md).

![Overall information](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6633219951/p49556.png)

You can click the number below each module to go to the **Security report** page to view detailed data. For more information, see [View security reports](/intl.en-US/.md).

You can click the downward arrow in the lower part of this part to display the trend charts of the corresponding requests in each module.

**Note:** If you select All, the top 5 domain names with the most data volume and their data are displayed.

## Request analysis charts

-   Trend charts: display the trend charts of **Requests**, **QPS**, **Bandwidth**, and **Response Code** within a specified time period. The minimum time granularity is one minute.

    **Note:**
