# Manage log storage {#concept_amz_slz_qfb .concept}

After WAF Log Service is activated, log storage is allocated for your WAF Log Service based on the specified log storage size. You can view the usage of the log storage on the **Log Service** page in the Web Application Firewall console.

## View the usage of the log storage {#section_obl_hnz_qfb .section}

You can view the usage of the log storage that is generated by the WAF log query and analysis service at any time.

**Note:** It takes two hours for changes in the storage usage to be updated in the console. You need to upgrade the log storage when only a little log storage space is available.

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Web Application Firewall console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/waf).
2.  Choose **App Market** \> **App Management**, select the region where your WAF instance is located, and then click Real-time Log Query and Analysis Service.
3.  At the top of the Log Service page, view the usage of log storage.

## Upgrade log storage {#section_uqq_2rz_qfb .section}

To upgrade the log storage size, click **Upgrade Storage** at the top of the Log Service page.

**Note:** If log storage is full, new log data cannot be written to the exclusive logstore. We recommend that you upgrade log storage before log storage is full.

## Clear log storage {#section_gsv_lsz_qfb .section}

You can delete all log entries in the log storage as needed. For example, you can delete the log entries generated during the test phase to make full use of the log storage by recording only log entries that is generated during the production phase.

Click **Clear** at the top of the Log Service page, and click Confirm to delete all log entries in the log storage.

**Notice:** Log entries that are deleted cannot be restored. Delete log entries with caution.

**Note:** You can clear the log storage for only a limited number of times.
