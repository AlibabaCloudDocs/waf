# Renewal and upgrade {#concept_uq5_gdn_42b .concept}

To prevent your business from being affected when the Alibaba Cloud WAF subscription expires, you can manually renew your subscription or enable automatic renewal before expiration. If the specification of your current Alibaba Cloud WAF subscription does not meet your needs, you can upgrade the service.

## Renew Alibaba Cloud WAF {#section_nt4_hdn_42b .section}

Before your Alibaba Cloud WAF subscription expires, you can renew it to extend the duration of the service.

**Renewal reminder**

The system sends a reminder SMS or email, seven days before your service expires. You can renew your subscription before it expires, to enjoy uninterrupted service. If the subscription is not renewed before its expiry, you are allowed seven additional days to renew your subscription. If the subscription is still not renewed within this extended period, the WAF instance is released and the website is no longer protected.

**Procedure**

You can manually renew your subscription on the Alibaba Cloud WAF console, or perform manual or automatic renewal on the Renew page of Billing Management.

Follow these steps to manually renew your subscription on the Alibaba Cloud WAF console:

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/waf).
2.  At the top of the page, select the region of your WAF instance \(Mainland China or International\).
3.  In the upper-right corner, click **Renew**.

4.  On the Renew page, select **Renewal Duration** and proceed with the payment.

Follow these steps to manage renewal for your subscription on the Renew page of Billing Management:

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/waf).
2.  On the top menu bar, click **Billing Management** \> **Renew**.
3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Web Application Firewall**.
4.  On the Web Application Firewall page, select the web application firewall instance to be renewed and apply one of the following renewal methods.

    -   If you want to extend the duration of the service to a certain time, you can click **Renew** on the **Manually Renew** page. On the Renew page, select the expected renewal duration and complete the payment.
    -   If you want to enable a long-term subscription, you can click **Enable Auto-Renew** on the **Manually Renew** page. In the Enable Auto-Renew dialog box, select Auto-Renewal Cycle and click **Enable Auto-Renew**. When auto-renewal is enabled, Alibaba Cloud WAF will perform renewal on your behalf before the subscription expires. The renewal duration equals to the auto-renewal cycle, and renewal fees will be deducted from your account.

        When auto-renewal is enabled for a WAF instance, you can edit its renewal cycle or disable auto-renewal for it on the **Auto-Renew** page.

        **Note:** 

        -   Auto-renewal fees will be incurred 3 days before the service expires. Make sure you have enough balance in the payment method specified for your account.
        -   If you manually renew your instance before the billing day, auto-renewal is then performed based on the new expiration date calculated by your manual renewal plan.
        -   If you enable auto-renewal today, it will be effective from tomorrow.
        -   Auto-renewal payment supports coupons.
    -   If you decide not to use Alibaba Cloud WAF after the instance expires, click **Don't Renew**, and confirm **Don't Renew**. If you choose not to renew, you will be reminded only once before the instance expires. You can change your settings on the **Don't Renew** page anytime before the instance is stopped.
