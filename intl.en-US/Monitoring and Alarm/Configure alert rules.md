# Configure alert rules

Web Application Firewall \(WAF\) allows you to customize alert rules. You can specify the notification methods in which you receive security events and system alerts.

## Upgrade to the new version of the Alarm Settings feature

WAF integrated with the new version of the Alarm Settings feature that is provided by Cloud Monitor on February 10, 2020. If you use WAF instances that were created before this date, click **Free Update** on the **Alarm Settings** page in the WAF console to upgrade the feature to the new version. The original alert rules become invalid after the upgrade. You must go to the Cloud Monitor console to configure notification methods for security events and system alerts for WAF immediately.

**Note:** The Alarm Settings feature of the original version was taken offline on April 5, 2020. The alert rules in the original version became invalid after this date. To avoid any impacts on your alert rules, we recommend that you upgrade the feature before April 5, 2020 and configure the notification methods for security events and system alerts.

## Background information

WAF integrates with Cloud Monitor and sends the basic statistics and attack events of all domain names to Cloud Monitor. Cloud Monitor sorts out security events and system alerts from massive protection logs that are generated by WAF. You can customize notification and handling methods for different types of events to achieve comprehensive and effective daily O&M.
