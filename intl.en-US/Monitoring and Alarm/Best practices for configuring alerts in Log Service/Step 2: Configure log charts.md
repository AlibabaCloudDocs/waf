# Step 2: Configure log charts

After you create a log analysis dashboard, you can edit or delete log charts on the dashboard. In addition, you can create a new log chart by copying an existing chart.

A log analysis dashboard is created. For more information, see [Step 1: Create a WAF log analysis dashboard](/intl.en-US/Monitoring and Alarm/Best practices for configuring alerts in Log Service/Step 1: create a WAF log analysis dashboard.md).

The practices provide 13 default chart configuration examples. For more information, see [WAF log charts and alert configuration examples](/intl.en-US/Monitoring and Alarm/Best practices for configuring alerts in Log Service/WAF log charts and alert configuration examples.md).

Before you create a chart based on the examples and configure alerts during the chart creation process, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with how to configure alerts. For more information, see [Step 3: Configure log alerts](/intl.en-US/Monitoring and Alarm/Best practices for configuring alerts in Log Service/Step 3: Configure log alerts.md).

1.  Enter the customized WAF log analysis dashboard.

    For more information, see [Step 1: Create a WAF log analysis dashboard](/intl.en-US/Monitoring and Alarm/Best practices for configuring alerts in Log Service/Step 1: create a WAF log analysis dashboard.md).

2.  In the upper-right corner of the dashboard, click **Edit**.

    ![Edit icon](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6962023851/p76399.png)

    The dashboard enters the edit mode.

3.  In this mode, you can edit or delete the charts on the dashboard. In addition, you can create a new chart by copying a chart.

    **Note:** You can copy a chart to create a new chart. Then, you can edit the new chart. You can add more than one chart to a dashboard. This allows you to display data and configure alerts in various ways.

    -   Copy a chart to create a new chart.
        1.  Find the chart that you want to copy. Move the pointer over the ![Actions](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/6962023851/p77314.png) icon in the upper-right corner of the chart, and click **Copy**.

            After you copy a chart, an identical chart appears.

        2.  On the Edit page, modify the chart configurations, such as **Chart Name**, SQL statements, relative data collection period, and chart type. Then, click **OK**.

            **Note:** If you have modified the SQL statements, you must click **Preview** before you click **OK**. This operation triggers a check of the statement validity. If the SQL statements are invalid, an error message appears, and the **OK** button becomes unavailable. You can click **OK** only after you make sure the statements are valid.
