# How to view the WAF back-to-source IP addresses? {#concept_onw_pcl_q2b .concept}

To avoid your WAF’s back-to-source IP addresses from being blocked or slowed down by the origin, you can add the WAF’s back-to-source IP addresses to the whitelist of your origin’s security group, firewall, or other host security protection software.

Follow these steps to view the WAF’s back-to-source IP address segment.

1.  Log on to the [Web Application Firewall console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/waf).
2.  Go to the **Management** \> **Website Configuration** page.
3.  Click **Alibaba Cloud WAF IP range** in the upper corner of the page.

You can add the WAF back-to-source IP address segment to the whitelist of your origin server's security group, firewall or other host security protection software, to deploy protection for your origin server. For more information, see [Protect origin](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Best Practices/Protect your origin server.md#).
