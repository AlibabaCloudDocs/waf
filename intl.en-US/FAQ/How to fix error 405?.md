# How to fix error 405? {#concept_vrz_wbl_q2b .concept}

Once you deploy WAF, a 405 error is reported if you try to access any URL that can pose a security threat to your website and access to that URL is denied.

However, if you confirm the access to a few URLs is a normal business request, you can [Configure HTTP ACL policy](../../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Protection configuration/HTTP ACL policy.md#) to add access rules. This allows access for specific URLs or source IP addresses.
